A pretty quick and dirty solution for the maze challenge from the final exercise of TFE4152 - Design of Integrated Circuits that was trown together in a couple of hours. Reached 4th place on the class scoreboard with the "Twice per tick" commit.

See https://github.com/wulffern/dicex/tree/main/maze for original code and problem description.
